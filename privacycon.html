<h1 class="header">Arguments Against Internet Privacy</h1>
<article class="textcontainer">The following are a collection of arguments made against Internet Privacy:<h2>Internet Privacy Allows Individuals to Commit Injustices without Consequences</h2>
<table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="14">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td width="48%" valign="top"><p>Cybercrime is a prominent issue and a major concern for advocates against total internet privacy. While total internet privacy may protect an individual from damaging consequences from their online activities, this unfortunately extends to criminal activities committed on the internet. An individual who breaks the law online often does not face any consequences for their actions.</p>
        <p>One can find a philisophical discussion on this type of issue within one of Plato's dialogues, <i>The Ring of Gyges</i>. Within this dialogue, Glaucon argued that a man who did not have to fear consequences (due to wearing a ring that would render them invisible) would freely commit crime because said consequences are the only things that stop one from doing so, even if that individual would otherwise be considered &quot;virtuous&quot;. </p>
        <p>By removing the fear of consequences in cybercrime, individuals would have less reasons to not commit crimes on the internet, and thus may be more inclined to do so. However, individuals who do not choose to remain anonymous on the internet are less likely to commit these crimes, as they are more likely to face consequences and prosecution for what they do on the internet.</p>
        <p>On top of that, it makes it much easier to act abusively towards other individuals, even if it is not considered illegal. For example, this could be harassing a user in a comments section of a blog. An individual is less likely to face long term consequences for their actions while hidden behind the internet, and thus is more likely to act in such a manner.</p></td>

<article class="textcontainer"><h2>Internet Privacy Makes it Harder to Verify Sources and Identities</h2>
<table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="14">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td width="58%" align="left" valign="top"><p>Another downside to total internet anonymity is that it makes it harder to verify the identity of an individual and source any information that they may provide. Most websites do not require an individual to submit any proof of their identity when creating an account, and as a result, anyone can pretend to be anybody they would like. Additionally, an individual can say anything they would like and it is much harder to verify said information, especially because of how easy it is to fabricate your own facts and source material online.</p>
        <p>For example, an individual on the internet is able to create an account on a social networking website (such as Facebook) and claim that they are a doctor. Since they are not required to provide any proof of their claim, it is much harder to verify that they are being honest about that claim. They can then go and state false information to an audience, again without any proof to back up their claims other than their own word. This additional difficulty in verifying information has led to numerous problems in recent time, as this has aided in the widespread nature of conspiratorial ideologies such as Anti-Vaccination and Flat-Earth theories.</p>
        <p>This issue is not helped by the fact that the nature of the internet has made it even easier for false information to spread like wildfire. It is incredibly easy to find &quot;source information&quot; that supports an individual's viewpoint, and similarly easy to just create said source material themselves. One can even use a different identity online to create a source material that they then share as their own personality, or vice versa, creating a degree of separation that makes it easier to believe what they are being shown. Source materials now have to be verified by sources that are considered &quot;trustworthy&quot;. However, psychological study indicates that individuals are more likely to consider a source to be true if they had previously believed or hoped to believe that said source is correct before encountering the material (see: <a class="inlinelink" href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/blog/science-choice/201504/what-is-confirmation-bias" title="Psychology Today: What is Confirmation Bias?">Confirmation Bias</a>).</p></td>
